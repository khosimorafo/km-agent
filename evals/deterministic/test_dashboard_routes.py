"""DETERMINISTIC EVAL — the dashboard's public surface, pinned.

This is a characterization net, not a feature test. It exists so that moving or
deleting code inside dashboard.py cannot silently remove a URL the browser calls
or a key the page reads. Written BEFORE the dead-code deletion and the 1,695 ->
~880 line split, and it stayed green through both without a single edit to the
route lists — which is the whole point: the browser's contract never moved, only
the code behind it.

The handler list below is checked with getattr(dashboard, ...), so it also pins
the re-exports. After the split, most handlers LIVE in arena / catalog /
settings_api / browser_agent and are imported here. If one stops being reachable
from `dashboard`, the router breaks and this fails.

If you add a route or a payload key on purpose, update the list below in the
same commit — that edit is the review signal that the public surface changed.
